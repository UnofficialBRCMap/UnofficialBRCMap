      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        First of all, the Unofficial BRC Map would not be possible without YOUR PARTICIPATION. We're merely the shell for all your shiny pearls of information! Thank you to all of our gracious contributors!
        <br><br>
        This is a passion project by a small group of people who love Black Rock City and also maps! We collect placement information voluntarily from camps and artists who wish to share their approximate location in advance of arriving to the playa. Of course, our pin placements are only good guesses and may not reflect reality for those lucky enough to travel to the playa in person. Our map should give you a decent idea of what you might find in your neighborhood, but you'll certainly find even more and better attractions once you're there!
